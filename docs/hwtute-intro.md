Tutorial on hardware programming with Seashell
-------

This tutorial is targeted to introduce hardware programming in high-level languages to C programmers or hardware programmers interested in moving into high level synthesis. This tutorial will use:
 * Seashell, which is a type overlay to ensure hardware safety of your program and porgram synthesis to C/C++
 * Buildbot, which is infrastructure created to submit a seashell program and receive hardware results

Buildbot itself hides away some other tools that can be replaced with different tools,
 * Vivado HLS, which is a C/C++ to Verilog/VHDL translator on top of Vivado synthesis tool flow
 * Xilinx Zedboard SoC development board, which has an arm CPU and a Zync FPGA with memory and interconnections which have some configurability

### Prerequisites
* Basic knowledge on C/C++
* Some means to create files, zip them and submit them to [Buildbot](http://gorgonzola.cs.cornell.edu:8000/) to run externally
  or a backend with [seac compiler](https://github.com/cucapra/seashell), HLS and a CPU-FPGA heterogeneous platform to run locally.

We'll be going through the following examples to get familiarized with the tools and to use the infrastructure to create interesting programs.

1. [vector-vector add on host processor](hwtute-01.html)
   - Run a program on heterogeneous platform host processor
2. [vector-vector add on reconfigurable hardware controlled by the host processor](hwtute-02.html)
   - Design and interface hardware module in Buildbot, Familiarize with Seashell, Run a CPU-FPGA program on a heterogeneous platform
3. [optimized vector-vector add on reconfigurable hardware controlled by the host processor](hwtute-03.html)
   - Introduce to commonly used hardware optimizations, array partition, loop unroll and pipelining
4. [matrix multiplication]()
   - Usage and optimization of nested loops, Using local variables,
5. [convolution]()
   - Data transfer methods, Using memory,
