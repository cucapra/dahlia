This section details the currently existing text editor support for Fuse.

## Vim

We have a syntax highlighting plugin called `vim-fuse`.

- If you're using [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), install
  `vim-fuse` by running this in the `seashell/` directory:
    - `cp -r tools/vim ~/.vim/bundle/vim-fuse`
