\begin{abstract}
With the end of Moore's law in sight, FPGAs and reconfigurable hardware are
gaining prominence in a variety of computationally heavy domains such as
machine learning. However, writing hardware programs remains challenging
because (1) the abstractions provided by hardware design languages (HDLs) is
too low level and (2) high-level synthesis (HLS) tools, which promise to
raise the level of abstraction, provide ad hoc mechanisms on top of unsafe
languages like C and C++ and repurpose wildly inefficient EDA flows. Towards
the goal of creating a safe and expressive abstractions for hardware
programming, we present Seashell, a programming language that exposes the
unique resource constraints in hardware and guarantees hardware
realizability. This is in contrast to contemporary HLS tools which try, and
fail, at transparently compiling C/C++ programs to hardware. HLS tools often
add inefficient hardware in order to compile these programs and make it
significantly harder to understand the performance characteristics of the
generated hardware. Instead of hiding hardware constraints, Seashell exposes
them to the developer and simplifies reasoning about them.

\subsection{Halide}
Halide [CITE] is a domain specific language for writing image processing
pipelines that allows programmers to separately specify the processing pipeline
and the scheduler. It has also been extended to be compiled to hardware [CITE].

\rn{One question I want to answer here in particular is that most people are
using accelerators for doing array based calculations, why not go the Halide
way and build a language that has the right high level primitives for that?}
\xxx[as]{Yep, this question---``why not use a DSL?''---is an important one to answer. The gist of my position is that DSLs represent a trade-off that is sometimes but not always appropriate: you specify things at a very high level, but you get less control over how the hardware actually works and you have to make do with the primitives that the DSL designers offer you. Even with a million DSLs out there, there will \emph{still} be tasks for which a general-purpose language is what you want---if nothing else, then at least for the ``glue'' between chunks of code implemented in DSLs.}

\subsection{Spatial}
Spatial [CITE] is a domain specific programming language embedded in Scala
and compiles to Chisel. It introduces several new abstractions for extracting
parallelism out of accelerators. Seashell is not Spatial because \ldots

\rn{Similar question. Why not build higher level primitives like
spatial and leave the safety checking and compilation to the compiler?}
\xxx[as]{And a similar answer: automation like represents an implicit trade-off. You get to not worry about the details, but then the details are hidden from you. So if you find you're getting back hardware out of Spatial, you don't see it manifest in the code and you have no recourse to fix it. Instead, we do the hard work to make all the details visible at the language level. This should be better for (a) experts who want exacting control over the hardware they generate, and (b) eventually building higher-level tools that enhance automation on top of this abstraction.}
