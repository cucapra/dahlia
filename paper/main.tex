\begin{abstract}
With the end of Moore's law in sight, FPGAs and reconfigurable hardware are
gaining prominence in a variety of computationally heavy domains such as
machine learning. However, writing hardware programs remains challenging
because (1) the abstractions provided by hardware design languages (HDLs) is
too low level and (2) high-level synthesis (HLS) tools, which promise to
raise the level of abstraction, provide ad hoc mechanisms on top of unsafe
languages like C and C++ and repurpose wildly inefficient EDA flows. Towards
the goal of creating a safe and expressive abstractions for hardware
programming, we present Seashell, a programming language that exposes the
unique resource constraints in hardware and guarantees hardware
realizability. This is in contrast to contemporary HLS tools which try, and
fail, at transparently compiling C/C++ programs to hardware. HLS tools often
add inefficient hardware in order to compile these programs and make it
significantly harder to understand the performance characteristics of the
generated hardware. Instead of hiding hardware constraints, Seashell exposes
them to the developer and simplifies reasoning about them.

\subsection{Halide}
Halide [CITE] is a domain specific language for writing image processing
pipelines that allows programmers to separately specify the processing pipeline
and the scheduler. It has also been extended to be compiled to hardware [CITE].

\rn{One question I want to answer here in particular is that most people are
using accelerators for doing array based calculations, why not go the Halide
way and build a language that has the right high level primitives for that?}

\subsection{Spatial}
Spatial [CITE] is a domain specific programming language embedded in Scala
and compiles to Chisel. It introduces several new abstractions for extracting
parallelism out of accelerators. Seashell is not Spatial because \ldots

\rn{Similar question. Why not build higher level primitives like
spatial and leave the safety checking and compilation to the compiler?}
