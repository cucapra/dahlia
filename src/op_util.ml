(* Index types generalize integers. We have not completely figured
   out operations between index types; but we'd like to allow normal
   integer operations between integers. [resolve_index_op t1 t2]
   allows operations between index types that represent *one* value
   at a particular moment, so the static component has cardinality one.
   The resulting type is currently set to be a signed dynamic integer of
   type idx<0..1, min_int..max_int>. This lets us add dynamic integers,
   static integers, etc., but disallows operations between sets of values. *)
