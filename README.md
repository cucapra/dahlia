Seashell provides a type system that makes programming FPGAs easier. To learn about how Seashell works and where it's headed, check out these links:

## Setup/Use

Install dependencies (in addition to OCaml and OPAM) and update the OPAM environment:

	$ opam install dune menhir core
	$ eval $(opam config env)

Then, build and install `seac` compiler:

    $ dune build
    $ dune install

(You can also just type `make` to do the same thing.)
Now you can generate HLS programs from your Seashell programs.
For example:

    $ seac < examples/float.sea > float.c
