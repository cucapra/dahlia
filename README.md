Seashell provides a type system that makes programming FPGAs easier. To learn about how Seashell works and where it's headed, check out these links:

## Setup/Use

### Requirements
The following are required to build the seashell compiler.
  - [Opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-2-0-0-rc4/).
  - [Dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune). Run `opam install dune`.
  - Menhir. Run `opam install menhir`.

### Installation

Install dependencies (in addition to OCaml and OPAM) and update the OPAM environment:

    $ opam install . && eval `opam env`

Then, run the following commands to install the `seac` CLI tool:

    $ dune build
    $ dune install

(You can also just type `make` to do the same thing.)
Now you can generate HLS programs from your Seashell programs.
For example:

    $ seac examples/float.sea > float.c

For more information about the CLI options, run:

    $ seac --help
